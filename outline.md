# What about volto

## What is volto

Volto is a full-featured frontend with the goal to replace the Plone frontend as we know it.


## Comparison to my approach

- vue-plone is a simple, lean framework to get you started.
- It doesn't replace the Plone frontend with all its functionality.
- It's a powerful alternative to server side page template rendering.
